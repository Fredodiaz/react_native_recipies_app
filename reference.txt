npm install react-navigation-stack @react-native-community/masked-view react-native-safe-area-context
Installation above allows to use navigation like in Udemy course.
Note: Some code may break, make sure it has the right installation package
because "createStackNavigator" was able to be installed from 
'react-navigation-stack' and also '@react-navigation/stack'
but the one that worked was 'react-navigation-stack' . . .

/*
    Note:
    React Native Navigation API got upgraded to version 5 (as of Feb 24 2020) and is why
    you may find that some functions such as createBottomTabNavigator
    may not work with certain dependencies because we are working with
    navigation that's not up to date.

/*
    Note: 
    There may be an easier way of passing down data to screens such
    as destructuring the props and passing down the item as a param
    or a prop to another screen rather than passing the id (which
    is part of the item). For when we redo this we can try it out 
    or at least understand why that may be a bad practice.

    Note:
    Currently implementing passing down data via params rather than
    query through id.
